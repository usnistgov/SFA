outputMsg "The viewer generates an HTML file 'myfile-sfa.html' that is shown in the default web browser.  An
Internet connection is required.  The HTML file is self-contained and can be shared with other
users including those on non-Windows systems.  The viewer does not support measurements.

The viewer can be used without generating a spreadsheet.  See Generate on the Options tab.  The
Part Only option is useful when no other Viewer features are needed and for large STEP files.

The viewer supports boundary representation (b-rep) exact geometry.  For AP242, tessellated and
polyhedral b-rep geometry are supported.  Color, transparency, part edges, sketch geometry, and
assemblies are supported.  Part geometry viewer features:

- Part edges are shown in black.  Use the transparency slider to show only edges.  Some parts might
  not be affected by the transparency slider.  If a part is completely transparent and edges are
  not selected, then the part will not be visible.  In some cases transparency might look wrong for
  assemblies with many parts.

- Sketch geometry is supplemental lines created when generating a CAD model.  Sketch geometry is
  also known as construction, auxiliary, support, or reference geometry.  To show only sketch
  geometry, turn off edges and make the part completely transparent.  Sometimes processing sketch
  geometry will affect the behavior of the transparency slider.  Sketch geometry is not same as
  supplemental geometry.  See Help > Viewer > Supplemental Geometry

- Normals improve the default smooth shading by explicitly computing surface normals to improve the
  appearance of curved surfaces.

- Quality controls the number of facets used for curved surfaces.  Higher quality uses more facets
  around the circumference of a cylinder.  Using High Quality and the Normals options results in
  the best appearance for part geometry.  See the new feature below for the Alternative B-rep
  Geometry Processing.

- AP242 tessellated part geometry is typically written to a STEP file in addition to or instead of
  b-rep part geometry.  A wireframe mesh, outlining the facets of the tessellated surfaces can be
  shown with the Edges option.  In some cases, parts in an assembly might have the wrong position and
  orientation or be missing.  Quality and normals do not apply to tessellated part geometry.
  See Websites > CAx Recommended Practices (Tessellated 3D Geometry)

- The bounding box min and max XYZ coordinates are based on the faceted geometry being shown and
  not the exact geometry in the STEP file.  There might be a variation in the coordinates depending
  on the Quality option.  The bounding box also accounts for any sketch geometry if it is displayed
  but not graphic PMI and supplemental geometry.  The bounding box can be shown to confirm that the
  min and max coordinates are correct.  If the part is too large to rotate smoothly, turn off the
  part and rotate the bounding box.

- The origin of the model at '0 0 0' is shown with a small XYZ coordinate axis that can be switched
  off.  The background color can be changed between white, blue, gray, and black.

- See Help > Text Strings and Numbers for how non-English characters are supported.

For very large STEP files it might take several minutes to process the STEP part geometry.  To
speed up the process, select View and Part Only on the Generate tab.  The resulting HTML file might
also take several minutes to display in the web browser.  Select 'Wait' if the web browser prompts
that it is running slowly when opening the HTML file.

The viewer generates an X3D file that is embedded in the HTML file that is displayed in the default
web browser.  Select 'Save X3D ...' on the More tab to save the X3D file so that it can be shown in
an X3D viewer or imported to other software.  Part geometry including tessellated geometry and
graphic PMI is supported.  Use this option if an Internet connection is not available for the
Viewer.

The Viewer might indicate that there are possible syntax errors and to run the Syntax Checker.

See Help > User Guide (section 4)
See Help > Viewer for other topics

The viewer for part geometry is based on the NIST STEP to X3D Translator and only runs on 64-bit
computers.  It runs a separate program stp2x3d-part.exe from [file nativename $mytemp]
See Websites > STEP

Other STEP file viewers are available.  See Websites > STEP > STEP File Viewers.  Some of the
viewers are faster and have better features for viewing and measuring part geometry.  This viewer
supports many features that other viewers do not, including: graphic PMI, sketch geometry,
supplemental geometry, datum targets, viewpoints, clipping planes, point clouds, composite rosettes,
hole features, AP242 tessellated part geometry, and AP209 finite element models and results.  Try
the Open STEP Viewer with AP242 Domain Model XML files (.stpx)."

1 - Hidden buttons and sliders

Some checkboxes and sliders on the right side of the viewer might be hidden.  If hidden, they can
be shown by clicking on the buttons for More Options, Saved View Graphic PMI, and others.

2 - Cloud of points and point clouds

The cloud of points (COPS) geometric validation property are sampling points generated by the CAD
system on the surfaces and edges of a part.  The points are used to check the deviation of surfaces
from those points in an importing system.  The report for Validation Properties must be generated
to show the COPS.  See Websites > CAx Recommended Practices (Geometric and Assembly Validation Properties)

3D scanning point clouds are supported in AP242.  Point cloud colors, intensities, and normals are
not supported in the Viewer.

Points are shown with a blue dot.  In both cases, the exact points might not appear on part
surfaces because part geometry in the viewer is only a faceted approximation.  For parts in an
assembly, the COPS might have the wrong position and orientation.

3 - Section view clipping planes

Part geometry can be clipped by section view clipping planes defined in the STEP file.  Part Only
must not be selected on the Generate tab.  The planes are shown with a black square that might not
be centered on the model.  Checkboxes show the names of each clipping plane.  If there are
duplicate clipping plane names, a number in parentheses is appended to the name.  You have to
manually select the clipping plane that is associated with a viewpoint or saved view graphic PMI.

Use the option on the More tab to generate capped surfaces in the plane of a clipping plane.
Capped surfaces, in the plane of the black square, are generated when there is only one clipping
plane per section view.  Capped surfaces for parts in an assembly might be in the wrong position.
Sometimes capped surfaces are not generated.  Switching off parts in an assembly does not turn off
their capped surfaces.

4 - Parallel projection viewpoints

Use the option on the More tab to use parallel projection for saved view viewpoints defined in the
STEP file, instead of the default perspective projection.  See Help > Viewer > Viewpoints

5 - PMI placeholders

PMI placeholders provide information about the position, orientation, and organization of an
annotation without the graphic presentation of numeric values and symbols for geometric or
dimensional tolerances.  See Help > Viewer > PMI Placeholders

6 - B-rep part geometry processing

If curved surfaces for Part Geometry look wrong even with Quality set to High, select the
Alternative B-rep Geometry Processing method on the More tab.  It will take longer to process the
STEP file and the resulting Viewer file will be larger.

7 - Tessellated supplemental geometry

Supplemental geometry represented as tessellated geometry is supported.
See Help > Viewer > Supplemental Geometry

8 - Convert STL to AP242

STL files can be converted to STEP AP242 tessellated geometry that can be shown in the viewer.
In the Open File(s) dialog, change the 'Files of type' to 'STL (*.stl)'.  ASCII and binary STL
files are supported.  Tessellated geometry is not exact b-rep surfaces and may not be supported in
some CAD software.

9 - Composite rosettes defined by cartesian points and curves are shown in the viewer."

upper left corner of the viewer.  User-defined viewpoints are used with saved view graphic PMI.

If there are no user-defined viewpoints (saved views) in the STEP file, then front, side, top, and
isometric viewpoints are generated.  Since the default orientation of the part is not known, the
viewpoints might not correspond to the actual front, side, and top of the model.  The isometric
viewpoint might not be centered.  All of the viewpoints use perspective except for an additional
front parallel projection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are user-defined viewpoints (saved views) in the STEP file, then in addition to the saved
views from the file, two additional front viewpoints named 'Front (SFA)' are generated, one
perspective and the other a parallel projection.  Pan and zoom might not work with parallel
projection.

If there are duplicate saved view names, then a number in parentheses is appended to the name.  For
example, two viewpoints named MBD_A will appear as MBD_A (1) and MBD_A (2) for the Viewpoint name
in the upper left corner of the viewer when cycling through the viewpoints with PageDown.

Saved view names with non-English characters (Unicode) are supported in the viewer if a spreadsheet
is also generated.

On the More tab, parallel projection viewpoints as defined in the STEP file can be used instead of
the default perspective.  Also, if the model has viewpoints with and without graphic PMI, then the
viewpoints without graphic PMI can also be shown.  Those viewpoints are usually top, front, and
side viewpoints.

If there is graphic PMI associated with saved views, then the PMI is automatically switched
on/off when using PageDown if 'Saved View Viewpoints' is checked on the Generate tab.  If there are
duplicate saved view names as described above, then the list of Saved View Graphic PMI will append,
after a slash, the saved view name to the PMI name.

Saved views always show all part geometry and ignore any view-specific geometry that is not visible
in a view.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the viewer, use key 'a' to view all and 'r' to restore to the original view.  The function of
other keys is described in the link 'Use the mouse'.  Navigation uses the Examine Mode.

Sometimes a part is located far from the origin and not visible.  In this case, turn off the Origin
and Sketch Geometry and then use 'a' to view all.

Older implementations of saved views might not conform to current recommended practices.  The
resulting model orientation will look wrong.  Use the option on the More tab to correct for the
wrong orientation.  The position of the model might still be wrong.

The More tab option 'Show save view camera model viewpoints' can be used to debug the camera model
(view frustum) viewpoint geometry.

Saved views are ignored with Part Only.  Part visibility in saved views is not supported."

Clicking on the model shows the part name in the upper left.  The part name shown may not be in the
list of assemblies and parts.  The part might be contained in a higher-level assembly that is in
the list.

Processing sketch geometry might also affect the list of names.  Some assemblies have no unique
names assigned to parts, therefore there is no list of part names.  See Help > Text Strings and
Numbers for how non-English characters in part names are supported.

Nested assemblies are also supported where one file contains the assembly structure with external
file references to individual assembly components that contain part geometry.

NOTE: Graphic PMI, supplemental geometry, capped surfaces for clipping planes, and cloud of points
on parts in an assembly is supported, however, it has not been thoroughly tested and might have the
wrong position and orientation.

Transparency for assemblies with AP242 tessellated geometry might look wrong.  In some rare cases,

a Geometric Tolerance, then the tolerances do not reference the same geometric element.  For
example, the dimensional tolerance referencing the curved edge of a hole and the geometric
tolerance referencing the cylindrical surfaces of the same hole.

The association of the Datum Feature with a Geometric Tolerance is based on each referring to the
same geometric element.  However, the Graphic PMI might show the Geometric Tolerance and Datum
Feature as two separate annotations with leader lines attached to the same geometric element.

The number of decimal places for dimension and geometric tolerance values can be specified in the

reports for Semantic Representation PMI or Graphic Presentation PMI are selected.

Semantic PMI Coverage Analysis counts the number of PMI Elements in a STEP file for tolerances,
dimensions, datums, modifiers, and CAx-IF Recommended Practices for PMI Representation.  On the
Coverage Analysis worksheet, some PMI Elements show their associated symbol, while others show the
relevant section in the recommended practice.  PMI Elements without a section number do not have a
recommended practice for their implementation.  The PMI Elements are grouped by features related
tolerances, tolerance zones, dimensions, dimension modifiers, datums, datum targets, and other
modifiers.  The number of some modifiers, e.g., maximum material condition, does not differentiate
whether they appear in the tolerance zone definition or datum reference frame.  Rows with no count
of a PMI Element can be shown, see More tab.

Some PMI Elements might not be exported to a STEP file by your CAD system.  Some PMI Elements are
only in AP242 editions > 1.

If STEP files from the NIST CAD models (Examples > NIST CAD Models) are processed, then the
Semantic PMI Coverage Analysis worksheet is color-coded by the expected number of PMI elements in
each CAD model.  See Help > Analyzer > NIST CAD Models

The Graphic PMI Coverage Analysis counts the occurrences of the recommended name attribute defined
in the CAx-IF Recommended Practice for PMI Representation and Presentation of PMI (AP242).  The
name attribute is associated with the graphic elements used to draw a PMI annotation or placeholder.
There is no semantic PMI meaning to the name attributes.

outputMsg "If a STEP file from a NIST CAD model (CTC/FTC/STC) is processed, then the PMI in the STEP file is
automatically checked against the expected PMI in the corresponding NIST test case.  The Semantic
PMI Coverage and Summary worksheets are color-coded by the expected PMI in each NIST test case.

The color-coding only works if the STEP file name can be recognized as having been generated from
one of the NIST CAD models.  For example, nist_ctc_02-some-text.stp would recognize the STEP file
as being generated from CTC 2.  nist_ftc_06-more-text.stp would be for FTC 6 and
nist_stc_10-whatever.stp would be for STC 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Semantic PMI Summary *
This worksheet is color-coded by the Expected PMI annotations in a test case drawing.
- Green is an Exact match to an expected PMI annotation in the test case drawing
- Green (lighter shade) is an Exact match with Exceptions
- Cyan is a Partial match
- Yellow is a Possible match
- Red is No match

The following Exceptions are ignored when considering an Exact match:
- repetitive dimensions 'nX'
- different, missing, or unexpected dimensional tolerances in a Feature Control Frame (FCF)
- some datum features associated with geometric tolerances
- some modifiers in an FCF
- all around symbol

Some causes of Partial and Possible matches are, missing or wrong:
- diameter and radius symbols
- numeric values for dimensions and tolerances
- datum features and datum reference frames
- modifiers for dimensions, tolerance zones, and datum reference frames
- composite tolerances

On the Summary worksheet the column for Similar PMI and Exceptions shows the most closely matching
Expected PMI for Partial and Possible matches and the reason for an Exact match with Exceptions.

Trailing and leading zeros are ignored when matching a PMI annotation.  Matches also only consider
the current capabilities of PMI annotations in STEP AP242 and CAx-IF Recommended Practices.  PMI
annotations for hole features including counterbore, countersink, and depth are also supported.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Graphic PMI Coverage Analysis *
This worksheet is color-coded by the expected number of PMI elements in a test case drawing.  The
expected results were determined by manually counting the number of PMI elements in each drawing.
Counting of some modifiers, e.g., maximum material condition, does not differentiate whether they
appear in the tolerance zone definition or datum reference frame.
- A green cell is a match to the expected number of PMI elements. (3/3)
- Yellow, orange, and yellow-green means that less were found than expected. (2/3)
- Red means that no instances of an expected PMI element were found. (0/3)
- Cyan means that more were found than expected. (4/3)
- Magenta means that some PMI elements were found when none were expected. (3/0)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the Semantic PMI Summary results, color-coded percentages of Exact, Partial, Possible and
Missing matches is shown in a table below the Semantic PMI Coverage Analysis.  Exceptions are
counted as an Exact match and do not affect the percentage, except one or two points are deducted
when the percentage would be 100.

The Total PMI on which the percentages are based on is also shown.  Coverage Analysis is only based
on individual PMI elements.  The Semantic PMI Summary is based on the entire PMI feature control
frame and provides a better understanding of the PMI.  The Coverage Analysis might show that there
is an exact match for all of the PMI elements, however, the Semantic PMI Summary might show less
than exact matches.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Missing PMI *
Missing PMI refers to semantic PMI and does not imply that the corresponding graphic annotation is
missing.  Missing PMI annotations on the Summary worksheet or PMI elements on the Coverage
worksheet might mean that the CAD system or translator:
- PMI annotation defined in a NIST test case is not in the CAD model
- did not follow CAx-IF Recommended Practices for PMI (See Websites > CAx Recommended Practices)
- has not implemented exporting a PMI element to a STEP file
- mapped an internal PMI element to the wrong STEP PMI element

* User-defined Expected PMI *
A user-defined file of expected PMI can also be used.  The file must be named SFA-EPMI-yourstepfilename.xlsx
Contact the developer for more information.  This feature is not documented in the User Guide.

NOTE - Some of the NIST test cases have complex PMI annotations that are not commonly used.  There
might be ambiguities in counting the number of PMI elements.

characters in European languages (for example ), and Asian languages that use different characters
sets such as Japanese or Cyrillic.  Text strings with non-English characters or symbols are usually
on descriptive measure or product related entities with name, description, or id attributes.

According to ISO 10303 Part 21 section 6.4.3, Unicode can be used for non-English characters and
symbols with the control directives \\X2\\ and \\X0\\.  For example, \\X2\\00E9\\X0\\ is used for the
accented character .  Some CAD software does not support these control directives when exporting
or importing a STEP file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spreadsheet - Use the option on the More tab to support non-English characters using the \\X2\\
control directive.  In some cases the option will be automatically selected based on the file size
or schema.  There is a warning message if \\X2\\ is detected in the STEP file and the option is not
selected.  In this case the \\X2\\ characters are ignored and will be missing in the spreadsheet.
Non-English characters that do not use the control directives might be missing in the spreadsheet.
Control directives are supported only if Excel is installed.

Unicode characters for GD&T symbols are used by Equivalent Unicode Strings reported on the
descriptive_representation_item worksheet and worksheets for semantic and graphic PMI where there
is an associated PMI validation property.  Equivalent Unicode Strings are not documented in the
User Guide.  See the Recommended Practice for PMI Unicode String Specification.

Unicode characters using \\X2\\ control directives are not processed for attribute strings on
Geometry entities and some Presentation entities.  The \\X\\ and \\S\\ control directives are supported
by default although they are no longer implemented in STEP files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viewer - All control directives are supported for part and assembly names.  Non-English characters
that do not use the control directives might be shown with the wrong characters.

Support for non-English characters that do not use the control directives can be improved by
converting the encoding of the STEP file to UTF-8 with the Notepad++ text editor or other software.
Regardless, some non-English characters might cause a crash or prevent the viewer from running.
See Help > Crash Recovery

The Syntax Checker identifies non-English characters as 'illegal characters'.  You should test your
CAD software to see if it supports non-English characters or control directives.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numbers in a STEP file use a period '.' as the decimal separator.  Some non-English language
versions of Excel use a comma ',' as a decimal separator.  This might cause some real numbers to be
formatted as a date in a spreadsheet.  For example, the number 1.5 might appear as 1-Mai.

To check if the formatting is a problem, process the STEP file nist_ctc_05.stp included with the
SFA zip file and select the Geometry Entity Type category.  Check the 'radius' attribute on the
resulting 'circle' worksheet.

To change the formatting in Excel, go to the Excel File menu > Options > Advanced.  Uncheck
'Use system separators' and change 'Decimal separator' to a period . and 'Thousands separator' to a
comma ,

This change applies to ALL Excel spreadsheets on your computer.  Change the separators back to
their original values when finished.  You can always check the STEP file to see the actual value of
the number.
