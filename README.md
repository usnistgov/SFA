# STEP File Analyzer and Viewer

The free [STEP File Analyzer and Viewer](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/step-file-analyzer-and-viewer) (SFA) 
generates a spreadsheet and visualization from an ISO 10303 Part 21 STEP file.  The STEP File Viewer supports parts, assemblies, dimensions, 
tolerances, and more.  The Analyzer generates a spreadsheet of all entity and attribute information; reports and analyzes any semantic PMI, 
graphic PMI, and validation properties for conformance to recommended practices; and checks for basic STEP file format errors.  STEP AP242, AP203, 
AP214, AP209, and other APs and EXPRESS schemas are supported.

**Viewer and Spreadsheet Examples:** [Part with graphic PMI for GD&T](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/graphical-pmi-viewer.html),

[Bracket assembly](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/bracket.html), 
[Section view clipping planes](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/section-views.html), 
[AP209 finite element analysis models](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/ap209-viewer.html), 
[Spreadsheet](https://www.nist.gov/document/sfa-semantic-pmi-spreadsheet) with reports for semantic PMI, graphic PMI, and validation properties.
