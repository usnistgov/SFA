# STEP File Analyzer and Viewer

The free [STEP File Analyzer and Viewer](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/step-file-analyzer-and-viewer) (SFA) 
generates a spreadsheet and visualization from an ISO 10303 Part 21 STEP file.  STEP AP242, AP203,  AP214, AP209, and other APs and 
EXPRESS schemas are supported.

The STEP File Viewer supports parts, assemblies, graphic PMI for dimensions and tolerances, datum targets, sketch geometry, supplemental geometry, 
viewpoints, clipping planes, point clouds, composite rosettes, hole features, AP242 tessellated part geometry and polyhedral B-rep geometry, and 
AP209 finite element models and results.

Viewer Examples: [Part with graphic PMI for GD&T](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/graphical-pmi-viewer.html), 
[Box assembly](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/step-file-viewer.html), 
[Bracket assembly](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/bracket.html), 
[Section view clipping planes](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/section-views.html), 
[AP209 finite element analysis models](https://pages.nist.gov/CAD-PMI-Testing/ap209-viewer.html)

The Analyzer generates a spreadsheet of all entity and attribute information; reports and analyzes any semantic PMI, 
graphic PMI, and validation properties for conformance to recommended practices; and checks for basic STEP file format errors.

Spreadsheet Example: [Spreadsheet](https://www.nist.gov/document/sfa-semantic-pmi-spreadsheet) with reports for semantic PMI, graphic PMI, and 
validation properties.
